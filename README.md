### Hi there ğŸ‘‹ I'm John!

**John123Allison/john123allison** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm a student at NC State University studying Political Science and Computer Science. Weird combo, right? I just like both!

I'm currently serving as the Vice President of NC State's Linux Users' Group, and help out with organizing Hackpack, NCSU's student hacking/cybersecurity group.

I spent this past summer as a Data Analyst intern at Red Hat, where I developed Python and Javascript tools to automate data cleaning processes.

Areas of interest include software and web security, computer architecture, and cryptography.
