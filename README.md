### Hi there ğŸ‘‹ I'm John!

I'm a student at NC State University studying Political Science and Computer Science. Weird combo, right? I just like both!

I'm currently serving as the Vice President of Hackpack, NCSU's student hacking/cybersecurity group.

I spent this past Summer as a data analyst intern at Red Hat, where I developed Python and Javascript tools to automate data cleaning processes.

Areas of interest include software and web security, static analysis, and reverse engineering.

- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ... anything!
