### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm John!

I'm a student at NC State University studying Political Science and Computer Science. Weird combo, right? I just like both!

I'm currently serving as the Vice President of NC State's Linux Users' Group, and help out with organizing Hackpack, NCSU's student hacking/cybersecurity group.

This coming Summer (2021) I will be joining Booz Allen Hamilton as a cybersecurity intern!

I spent this past Summer as a data analyst intern at Red Hat, where I developed Python and Javascript tools to automate data cleaning processes.

Areas of interest include software and web security, computer architecture, and cryptography.
